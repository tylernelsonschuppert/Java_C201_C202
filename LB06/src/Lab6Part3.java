 * Find the Pentagonal number of a positive integer
 * Purpose: The program implements a method to find the Pentagonal number of a positive integer.
            The program prompts the user to input a positive integer and outputs the Pentagonal number of the integer.
 
 * You should Implement a method named findPentagonal that takes an integer number as its formal parameter and 
 * returns the pentagonal number. A Pentagonal number is defined as follows,
 *           N*(3*N â€“ 1) / 2 where N > 0.
