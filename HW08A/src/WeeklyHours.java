Project:  Compute Weekly Hours for Each Employee
Problem Description:

Suppose the weekly hours for all employees are stored in a two-dimensional array.
Each row records an employeeâ€™s seven-day work hours with seven columns. For
example, the following array stores the work hours for eight employees. Write a
program that displays employee and their hours in decreasing order of the
total hours.
