 * Finding distance between points.
 * Purpose: The program prompts the user to input four integers where first two integers are (x1,y1) of a point, and the second two integers are (x2,y2) of a point on Cartesian plain. Display the distance between the two points.
     distance  = squareRoot((x1 - x2) * (x1-x2) + (y1 - y2) * (y1 - y2))
     Out of the two points, which one is the closest to point (0,0) and which is
     the furthest from (0,0) ?
