 * Finding incline angle of a line segment.
 * Purpose: The program prompts the user to input four integers where first two integers are (x1,y1) of a point, and the second two integers are (x2,y2) of a point on Cartesian plain. Compute and display the angle of incline of line segment. Use printf statement to output. You can find this angle using
     tan(θ) = Opposite / Adjacent, then to find θ, we find inverse tangent or atan.
